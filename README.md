# roslyn_codegen

Bunch of shit code to learn source generation, I wouldn't recommend any of it for production

Things to do, maybe?
- [x] Fast enums
- [x] Simple readable serialize (and slow)
    - [ ] Add async version
- [x] Get and Set attributes
- [ ] Clonable attribute
- [ ] Steal zig comptime 
- [ ] Better serialize
- [ ] Validators
- [ ] Logging attribute
- [ ] Commandline
    - [ ] Generate commands from methods with Command attribute
    - [ ] Commands initialized without reflection
    - [ ] Autocompletion precompiled
- [ ] Dependency injection
